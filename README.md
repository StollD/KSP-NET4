# KSP-NET4
Running KSP using the new and updated mono engine from Unity 2017.

**Note:** I have no idea how to apply this to a Mac, so the patcher will only work on Windows and Linux at the moment.

## How to use?
Simply head to the releases page and download the latest patcher version. Then execute the file you downloaded from inside your KSP Installation Directory. Linux users will have to install the mono runtime to be able to run the executable.

**IMPORTANT:** I recommend you to back up your game before executing the patcher since it might cause unwanted damage to the game. Better safe than sorry.
